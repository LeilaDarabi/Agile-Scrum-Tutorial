## Agile MAnifesto
we are uncoversing better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documnetation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan.

On the right, we have values, but our true priorities in Agie lie with the items on the left.

## 12 Principles
1 - The highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of software.

2 - Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
3 - Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference for the shorter timescale.
4 - Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
5 - Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
6 - The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
7 - Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8 - Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a consistent pace indefinitely.
9 - Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
10 - Simplicity, the art of maximizing the amount of work not done, is essential.
11 - The best architecture, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
12 - At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
