# Agile-Scrum
## What is Agile
- Agile means: Albe to move quickly and easily
- Agile is the ability to create and reposnd to changes.
- It is a way of dealing with and ultimately succeeding in and uncertain and turbulent environment.

## What is Agile Software Developmen
- It is an umbrella term for the Agile Software Developmen frameworks based on Agile Manifesto Values and 12 principles
- It is more than Agile Development frameworks like SCRUM and etc.
- Franeworks such as SCRUM, KANBAN, Extreme programming (XP), TDD, stand-ups etc. 
A very popular framework is SCRUM.

## Agile MAnifesto
we are uncoversing better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documnetation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan.

On the right, we have values, but our true priorities in Agie lie with the items on the left.

## 12 Principles
1 - The highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of software.

2 - Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.

3 - Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference for the shorter timescale.

4 - Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

5 - Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

6 - The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

7 - Working software is the primary measure of progress.

8 - Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a consistent pace indefinitely.

9 - Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

10 - Simplicity, the art of maximizing the amount of work not done, is essential.

11 - The best architecture, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

12 - At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

## What is Agile Software Development?
- Agile Software Development frameworks is a specific approach to planning, managing and executing work.
- Examples: SCRUM, KANBAN, Extreme programming (XP), Scalling Agile Frameworks like SAFe, LeSS, Nexus etc.
 
## Why Agile Software Development?
In the waterfall development approach, it follows a phase-by-phase structure, encompassing different stages:
- Requirements
- Design
- Development
- Testing
- Maintenance

However, the issue lies in the duration of each phase, as it tends to be extensive. Once the requirements are finalized, only then can we proceed to the design phase, which is based on the requirements documents. Subsequently, the design remains frozen until the requirements documentation is completed. This pattern continues for the other phases as well.
So feedback loop is very long and time consuming.


The Agile development approach begins with user stories, which describe how users will interact with the system. These user stories outline the functionality needed, providing a high-level overview.

Following user stories, the team delves into more detailed tasks that must be completed. 

Product delivery in Agile is carried out through iterative phases, known as sprints, typically lasting two to four weeks. The sprint duration depends on team size and capacity.

During each sprint, the team works on completing as much work as possible within the time frame. They prioritize tasks from the product backlog and aim to deliver a working product increment by the end of the sprint.

Testing is a crucial part of each sprint, ensuring that the delivered product increment meets quality standards. This might include testing features such as a login button to demonstrate progress.

In summary, Agile development is characterized by its incremental approach, with new work items pulled from the product backlog and released every two weeks. This iterative process allows for continuous improvement and adaptation throughout the development cycle.
